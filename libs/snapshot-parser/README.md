# Heap Snapshot File Parser

Helper library for parsing `.heapsnapshot` files generated by Node v8 / Chrome into a sqlite database.

# Resources

I found these resources helpful while writing the parser:

- [The head snapshot file format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/memory-problems/heap-snapshot-schema)
- [v8-profiler.h source code (The source of truth)](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-22.4/df/d0c/v8-profiler_8h_source.html)
